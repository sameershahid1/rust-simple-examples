# My Rust examples, which i have did while learning rust
There’s nothing particularly interesting in this repository; 
it's just some random simple code to help me familiarize myself 
with Rust. I am actually a Golang enthusiast and prefer using Neovim. 
So please disregard any assumptions you may have about me being a Rust 
lover—it's quite the opposite!
